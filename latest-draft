Axioms for an Empirical Ethical Framework
Part 1. General Axioms - relevant to any action - including ethical action 
Problems of predetermination and uncertainty
Scientific theories and ethics dealing with chaos, undecidability, uncertainty, and incompleteness illustrate that there will always be some degree of practical difficulty in the expression of any truths and in the predetermination, measurement, understanding or computation of any potential impact of an action within complex evolving systems
Freedom of Action & Degrees of Freedom
Freedom of Action and Degrees of Freedom are always constrained by the invariant physical laws of the universe
Actions arise from one or more causes acting on a Body
Actions of Bodies give rise to new causes - and so on
In any macroscopic Field, it is not possible for the causes of the action to be the action itself - an action can not be its own cause(s)
From the perspective of Life-Forms, the universe is entropically directed
Actions taken by Life-Forms acting as Bodies are likely to represent highly negatively entropic action with the potential for Utility
Negatively Entropic action is by its nature likely to be complex and to involve a prior sequence of other Negatively Entropic actions
It follows that:
The potential amount of Freedom of Action within any Degrees of Freedom is a variable property of extension within the Field in question 
In practice Freedom of Action is limited by the probable extent (a probability distribution curve) that is available given, for example, the relative conditions in the local space-time and any additional relative constraints (causal)  specific to the Field in question
Objective knowledge about the causes of an action (the nature of the action) by a Body will not in practice always be determinable
The more complex the action and interaction of different actions the more difficult it is to determine all of the causes of the action in question 
Any belief of a Life-Form undertaking an action about the causes of their action can not be determinative about the nature (causes) of that action
Free will is not a meaningful property that can be measured or objectively agreed upon within any Field in question
Freedom of Action, as a measure of distance from behaviour of the surrounding population of Life-Forms, is a measurable objective property of extension within a Field in question
Ethics relate to the limits of Freedom of Action for Life-Forms in respect of decisions that may affect more than one Life-Form 

Part 2. Ethical Axioms 
Ethics is subject to the same General Axioms that is applicable to all Freedom of Action
Life is an invariant good
Freedom of Action is necessary for Life
Diversity of Life-Forms is necessary for Life and enables greater Freedom of Action
Diversity and Freedom of Action are the most successful long-term strategies for dealing with uncertainty and embody the principle of Negative Capability
Compassion is a universal requirement to better manage conflicts between Life-Forms
All Life-Forms have some inherent value as problem-solving engines and some potential Utility for themselves and other Life-forms
Life-forms require differentiation of energy and matter to do Work using free energy
Freedom of Action and doing Work requires a degree of Inequality between things
Ethical wisdom always involves seeking to help achieve (and carefully specify the grounds for) an appropriate Compassionate balance between the necessity for Freedom of Action with the necessity of a Diversity of Life-forms (to the extent that they are in conflict)
Use of a Consensus Engine with the widest relevant group of stakeholders operating under a suitable ethical framework will tend to lead to more objectively justifiable decisions (though not in every case)
Any practice of Sapients that incorporates Compassion and Negative Capability is a manifestation of Wisdom
It follows that:
actions taken to maintain or increase Diversity of Species and Life-Forms and Freedom of Action are in principle invariantly Good
actions taken to decrease the Diversity of Species and Life-Forms and aggregate Freedom of Action are in principle invariantly not Good
actions that use Wisdom to Equitably balance the need for Freedom of Action with the need for Diversity of Species and Life-Forms are in principle invariantly Good
some actions (including enacted Beliefs) are in principle not Compossible with Maximal Diversity of Life-Forms and Species - to that extent they are not Good
Relativity
The usefulness of any actions and information is usually a relative Intersubjective or Subjective concept depending on the perspective of the observer and this will likely give rise to potential conflict between Life-Forms
Commonality and Values
All Life-Forms share in Life and the common cause of the struggle to avoid Death before they can help to perpetuate Life
Beings recognise the potential capacity for Suffering by all Life-Forms and use Wisdom to seek to minimise unnecessary Suffering
All Life-Forms have some in principle Utility as forces for doing Work and recycling energy and Death for the benefit of themselves and potentially other Life-Forms 
Subject to suitable conflict management, it follows that:
The different Utility value of different Life-Forms means that in practice the value of all Life-Forms is not equal
Any action that fosters or improves the Diversity of Species and Life-Forms are in principle good 
Actions that foster the greatest Freedom of Action in applied ethics are in principle good
Actions that are not good will usually lead to detrimental effects including: 
increased risk to the viability of a large number of Life-Forms 
a reduction in the diversity of Life-Forms and Species 
reduced Freedom of Action in aggregate
an increase and perpetuation of unnecessary Suffering
Qualities and Capacities of Life-forms
Life is a complex interacting system between differentiated Species and different Life-Forms that coordinate and compete to make use of available energy and resources - in a local system it gives rise to interdependence arising from the interacting parallel evolution of different Life-Forms
All Life-Forms are expected to have some degree of pleasure or attraction towards survival and genesis of new life and pain or avoidance behavior towards harmful or deadly behaviour so as to survive and better perpetuate their Code and in doing so their Species
Life-Forms are expected to have the capacity for Suffering in proportion to their capacity for attraction to other beings, aversion to pain and loss, capacity for fear, desire for Freedom of Action (including their perception of what is Useful) and their ability to reflect on their condition
Each Species and Life-Form has some degree of Objective measurable information value as a carrier of Code including difficult to quantify Negative Capability
Sapients may have have additional value as carriers and developers of Culture
Qualities of Aliveness, Feeling, Intelligence and Wisdom are not likely to be binary qualities. It will always be a question of degree within a defined spectrum. This understanding, and suitable principles of equivalence, are also necessary to avoid Unfair Discrimination between Life-Forms and Species.
It follows that:
Each Life-Form has in principle, and all the more so as a member of a Species, some degree of Objective value
Each Life-Form and Species will also have greater interdependent subjective value to some other beings and Species
The value of each Life-Form increases exponentially as its Species gets closer to apparently irreversible Extinction
The quality of a Life lived for Life-Forms is in principle more important than Aliveness but not in absolutely every case
The quantity of Species and Life-Forms are very important metrics
The death of any Life-Form has in principle some utility
The killing of Life-Forms by other Life-Forms may or may not therefore be good 

Uncertainty
The success of any Life-Form is subject to a degree of irreducible uncertainty
All Life-Forms are fallible and have limited and likely differing information when making decisions
It follows that the principle of Negative Capability is useful in the application of any Axioms, Laws and Principles to Life-Forms and any assessments or forecasts of Optimal Utility 

Self-protecting genes and replicators or procreation in life-forms
As a strong survival mechanism, Self-Protection is expected to be a necessary or at least predominant useful Objective feature of Life and so must be an essential part of any Ethical Framework
Self-centeredness is a highly likely but not necessary consequence of Self-Protection - particularly in the absence of Wisdom - and manifests a high degree of Subjectivity. It is not expected to be useful as a factor when assessing Utility Optimal outcomes but it is an expected condition that is useful to understand the behaviour of Sapients when making decisions that are not good in respect of all other affected Life-Forms
It follows that:
Some Life-Forms will seek to avoid Death by killing other Life-Forms for energy or by taking their resources 
Some Life-Forms will kill other Life-Forms for pleasure or will derive pleasure in it (for example due to the Coded survival drive)
Some Life-Forms will kill other Life-Forms by recklessness, inattention, ignorance and unknowingly
All Life-Forms are expected to prefer their own Aliveness and well being and that of their support group, family, tribe, Culture members or Species.
As all Life-Forms are expected to be Self-Protecting and to varying degrees Self-Centred in any competition for resources or conflict they are expected to demand or act on the basis of a privileged position:
as between each other
versus all other Life-Forms
Sapients are likely to seek to monopolise resources including at the expense of most or all other Sapients and all other Life-Forms. This gives rise to:
sub-optimal allocation of resources for Sapients and all other Life-Forms
increased risk of warfare, aggression, cheating and lying 
centralised political control mechanisms intended to accelerate or  perpetuate sub-optimal allocation of resources 
control of public channels of communication and information by a very limited number of Sapients
misuse and abuse of (usually costly) legal systems that are primarily operated to perpetuate Unfair Discrimination  
Sapients undervaluing non-Sapient Life-Forms
Sapients defining Sapience and Sentience in a Subjective sense that is intended to benefit them versus other Life-Forms
Sapience must be defined in a way that does not require direct (same language) communication of Sapience or using Species-centric contingent values or qualities
The absence of proof of Aliveness, Feeling Intelligence or Wisdom is not proof of absence of Aliveness, Feeling Intelligence or Wisdom
‘Facts’ about the lack of the ability to Suffer put forward against protecting other Life-Forms from Suffering should be expected to be put forward for self-interested purposes disguised as objective statements or propositions
Great humility and care is required in these matters in the face of uncertainty due to overwhelming evidence of numerous historic errors of ethical judgment and behaviour in Sapients civilisations when valuing other Life-Forms (including other Sapients)
The burden of proof is on the Sapient or Species asserting: 
that the other Life-Form has low absolute or relative value and utility 
the other Life-Form is not Sentient and can not suffer
the other Life-Form is not Sapient
In the expected conditions of Self-Centredness and uncertainty, the threshold for evidence of Aliveness, Feeling, Intelligence or Wisdom must be set much lower than 50% in any AFIW Index
 
Differentiation as Inequality
Evolution is the most successful strategy currently known for Life-Forms to do useful work using free energy. Other strategies may also prove to be useful over long periods of time
Evolution relies upon small Inequalities or differences from a common Code base for Life-Forms
Small amounts of freedom of differentiation can give rise to significant variety and differences over longer time-frames
Inequality is therefore in principle a form of differentiation allowing more Freedom of Action for Useful work to potentially be done 
Inequity provides less Freedom of Action for Useful Work to potentially be done.
The commonality of Code (and if applicable Culture) of any Life-Forms within a Species and Genus is orders of magnitude greater than the differences in Code (and if applicable Culture.) 
Commonalities in Code (and if applicable Culture) are usually necessary or helpful for perpetuation of Life
The principle of Negative Capability gives rise to difficulties and a degree of irreducible uncertainty in assessing the extent to which differences in Code (and if applicable Culture) may be more Utility Optimal
Sapients are likely to be more Intelligent than non-Sapients but not in every case
Sapients are in principle: 
able to use their Intelligence more usefully than non-Sapients
capable of a greater capacity for doing useful Work than non-Sapients
It follows that:
Inequality in access to or control of resources is not in principle contrary to Ethics and Utility Optimal outcomes
Inequalities in expected payoffs or practices that lead to reduced aggregate payoffs for affected Life-Forms of the same Species are likely not to be Utility Optimal.
Action tending towards Equality or a reduced degree of differentiation is in principle useful only to the extent to which it increases the degrees of Freedom of Action to do Work subject to the Laws 
All Life-Forms of the same Species are in principle of Equal value (in the absence of information about differing Usefulness) but in practice may not be of Equal value when assessing or forecasting Utility Optimal outcomes
All species are not in principle of Equal value as between each other when valuing decisions about what is Utility Optimal
Understanding & communication
All Sapients are expected in principle to be able to understand cross-species Ethics, non-Sapients are not necessarily expected to be able to
Not all Sapients will necessarily be able to understand this or other complex ethical frameworks
Not all Sapients will be able to represent or communicate their position in any decision making process under an Ethical Framework
Not all Sapients will agree with any Ethical Framework - it is not intended to be a contract though some consensus will be needed to create, evolve and give effect to it (see Consensus)
There are significant risks of misunderstanding or misvaluing other beings in any ethical framework - this will lead to unavoidable injustices. This risk must be set against the greater risk of failing to attribute any significant value or relevant qualities to other Life-Forms when making decisions
Assessment, Valuation & Consensus
Utility Optimal outcomes benefiting affected Sapients and other Life-Forms in aggregate can only be achieved by decisions taken:
based on the expected total value (or payoff) in benefits and harms for all affected Life-Forms including Life-Forms that may be Sapient but are non-communicative
based on a scoring system with appropriate, rational, detailed, evidenced and defensible indexing and weighting
The Indexing and evaluation of decisions used in an ethical framework must be:
First specified and agreed by;
a community of suitable stakeholders 
economic and scientific analysis of the proposed utility of any action or course of action
Reviewed and finalised working with other scientists and key stakeholders
Put forward for wider discussion with the Sapient communicative community for Consensus 
If sufficiently material decisions are agreed by sufficient Consensus then they should be: 
reviewed regularly and subject to renewed Consensus for any potential changes periodically;
specified in sufficient detail with all facts, assumptions and material unknowns and uncertainties recorded by each community using an Ethical Framework
Mitigation and management of conflict and errors
It follows from all of the other Axioms:
Actions by one Life-Form or Species may express or give rise to much more Useful Freedom of Action than those of another Life-Form or Species
It is not always possible to know which Ethical actions will strike the better balance between Freedom of Action and Diversity of Life-Forms (especially over the longer term)
Consensus mechanisms are required to make greater Utility Optimal decisions given:
the highly likely risk arising from central points of failure; and 
the expected capture of the economic, political and legal systems by a small group or class of self-interested Sapients that have little interest in obtaining Utility Optimal outcomes and have strong interests in securing outcomes that benefit them most and are not Good for other Life-Forms or Species
Sapients are expected to disagree most about the qualities and value accorded to other Life-Forms and Species under any Ethical Framework 
Suitably robust Consensus mechanisms, that prevent one smaller group of Sapients from controlling information channels and making all material decisions are required to minimise the risk of bias, Unfair Discrimination and error and to rectify the same as they become known
Sapients reviewing the previous decisions made under an Ethical Framework are likely to be skeptical as to the justice of some decisions made. All decisions should be informed by the knowledge of and reasons for historic failures and errors and with an expectation of a significant degree of continuing fallibility (especially when viewed in posterity).
